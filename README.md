# DNA-Sequence-Anomaly-Detector-for-Genetic-Disorders
This project is a **Deep Learning-based DNA Sequence Anomaly Detector** designed to identify mutations in DNA sequences and predict the probability of genetic disorders. It includes both a backend API (built with FastAPI) and a frontend web application (built with React.js).

## Features

- **DNA Mutation Detection**: Detect mutations in DNA sequences using a trained RNN/LSTM model.
- **Genetic Disorder Prediction**: Predict the likelihood of genetic disorders based on the provided DNA sequence.
- **REST API**: Backend API for predictions, built with FastAPI.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: A React-based web interface for submitting DNA sequences and displaying predictions.
- **Customizable**: Easily train the model with new datasets for specific applications.
